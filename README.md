# GAN
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The GAN model is a popular deep learning technique used for generating synthetic data, such as images or text. 
# Introduction
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a step-by-step walkthrough of building and training a GAN model. It includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help understand the underlying concepts of GANs and their implementation. 
# Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

1. Python (version 3.0 or higher)
2. Jupyter Notebook 
3. TensorFlow (version 2.12.0 or higher)
4. Keras (version 2.12.0 or higher)
5. NumPy
6. Matplotlib
